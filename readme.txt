Responsive, Easy to Use, Developer Friendly

== Description ==

WordPress users deserve a gallery plugin that doesn't frustrate them as they use it - they want a gallery plugin that is actually a joy to use. Other gallery plugins claim to be the best simply because they've been around the longest and have the most downloads. But we know better. MaxGalleria helps change the game by giving users a streamlined experience for creating and managing responsive WordPress galleries that look great on any device.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does MaxGalleria come with documentation? =
Yes. All documentation, which includes QuickStart Guides and developer hooks references, [can be found here](http://maxgalleria.com/documentation/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=mgrepo&utm_content=found-here&utm_campaign=plugin).

= Do I have to buy any of the addons to fully enjoy MaxGalleria? =
No. The MaxGalleria core plugin contains plenty of functionality to keep even the most die-hard gallery user happy. But for those looking to enhance their gallery experience, [MaxGalleria addons](http://maxgalleria.com/shop/category/addons/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=mgrepo&utm_content=maxgalleria-addons&utm_campaign=plugin) are the perfect choice.

= Why do I need a Google Developer API Key to add Youtube videos to a gallery?  =

Google has recently depreciated the use of the Youtube API version 2 which MaxGalleria uses. We have updated MaxGalleria version 3.1.8 to use version 3 of the API. The new API provides new features for application developers. And it also requires programs accessing Youtube data, such as thumbnails, titles and captions, to have a Google Developer API Key.

MaxGalleria users will now be directed to obtain a Google Developer API Key in order to add new videos to their galleries. Existing galleries are not effected by this change.

To obtain an API key visit this page for instructions: http://maxgalleria.com/youtube-api-key/
